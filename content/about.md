# Who Am I?

Hello There! I'm Luis Gonzalo Patiño. I'm a Control engineer from the National University of Colombia, Medellín Campus.  
Currently, I'm an IT Systems Administrator at [Academia T&T](http://catc.unal.edu.co).

## Interests and Expertise

> - **Operating Systems**
> - **IP and IoT Networks**
> - Virtualization Software
> - Data Security
> - Low-level programming

I've always been fascinated by technology and to learn how it works internally and resolve problems that may appear. That's why I have specialized in Networking,  with interests in deployment of Networks, troubleshooting, design of topologies, routing protocols and learn best security practices for said networks.  

I also love **Operating systems**: Configuration, management and see the different approaches they take to a lot of things. I've daily driven Linux for about 3 years now (Currently using [NixOS](https://nixos.org)). This love has also driven me to learn a lot about virtualization of said operating systems, this has been accomplished by learning (and utilizing) VMware vSphere at my current job for more than 4 years now.  
At home, I use Proxmox VE, which is an open source virtualization software. Thanks to these experiences, I have a lot of expertise when it comes to configure, deploy and provide technical support to VMs. More recently, I have also learned Docker and started replacing some VMs with Docker Containers using the Docker CLI and Compose. 

I'm specialized in configuration and management of Linux and Windows servers through VMware vSphere, Proxmox, and Docker;
Telecommunications networks in a variety of protocols, such as: Wifi, Ethernet, Zigbee; Programming in the languages Go, C/C++, and Python; and creation of scripts in Bash. General knowledge in cybersecurity, Cloud Platforms (Amazon AWS), SQL databases, and Web page administration in Wordpress/Joomla using PHP. Currently part of the Cisco Academy at the National University of Colombia, Medellín campus.
