## Interests and Expertise

> - **Operating Systems**
> - **IP and IoT Networks**
> - **Virtualization Software**
> - **Data Security**
> - **Low-level programming**

I've always been fascinated by technology and to learn how it works internally and resolve problems that may appear. That's why I have specialized in Networking,  with interests in deployment of Networks, troubleshooting, design of topologies, routing protocols and learn best security practices for said networks.  

I also love **Operating systems**: Configuration, management and see the different approaches they take. I've daily driven Linux for about 3 years now (Currently using [NixOS](https://nixos.org)). This love has also driven me to learn a lot about virtualization of said operating systems, this has been accomplished by learning (and utilizing) VMware vSphere at my current job for more than 4 years now.  
At home, I use Proxmox VE, which is an open source virtualization software. Thanks to these experiences, I have a lot of expertise when it comes to configure, deploy and provide technical support to VMs. More recently, I have also learned Docker and started replacing some VMs with Docker Containers using the Docker CLI and Compose.
